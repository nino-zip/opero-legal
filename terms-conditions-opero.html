    </p>
    
    <h2>3. User Content</h2>
    <p>
        Any input provided within the app (such as answers, drawings, or voice input)
        is processed locally on the device. This content is not reviewed, stored,
        or transmitted by the developer.
    </p>
    
    <h2>4. Advertising</h2>

        Opero may display advertisements within the app. These advertisements help

    </p>
    
    <p>
        Advertisements shown in Opero are configured to be appropriate for general

        of third-party advertisements.
    </p>
    
    <h2>5. Availability</h2>

        We aim to keep Opero available and functioning properly, but we do not

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
        All content, design elements, graphics, text, and functionality of Opero

    </p>
    
    <h2>7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
        Opero is provided "as is" and "as available" without warranties of any kind.
        To the maximum extent permitted by law, the developer is not liable for
        any damages resulting from the use or inability to use the app.
    </p>

        are encouraged to supervise their child’s use of the app and review its
        content and features.
    </p>
    
    <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
        We may update these Terms and Conditions from time to time. Continued use
        of the app after changes are published constitutes acceptance of the
        updated terms.
