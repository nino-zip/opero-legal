        <h1>Privacy Policy – Opero</h1>

        <p>
            <strong>Effective Date:</strong> January 10, 2026<br />
            <strong>Developer:</strong> .zipcave (nino.zip94)<br />
            <strong>Contact:</strong> <a href="mailto:nino.zip94@gmail.com">nino.zip94@gmail.com</a>
        </p>

        <p>
            Opero respects your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how information
            is handled when you use the Opero mobile application.
        </p>

        <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            Opero does not require users to create an account and does not collect
            personal information such as email addresses, phone numbers, or real names.
        </p>

        <p>
            The app may store the following information locally on the device:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>A display name and avatar emoji chosen by the user</li>
            <li>App preferences (such as accent color or reminder settings)</li>
            <li>Practice progress, test results, and performance data</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            All of this information is stored locally on the user’s device and is never
            transmitted to external servers controlled by the developer.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Microphone and Speech Recognition</h2>
        <p>
            Opero may request access to the device microphone and speech recognition
            features to allow users to answer math questions using their voice.
        </p>

        <p>
            Voice input is processed using Apple-provided APIs. Opero does not record,
            store, or transmit audio or voice data.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Notifications</h2>
        <p>
            Opero may send local notifications to remind users to practice math.
            These notifications are generated and managed entirely on the device
            and do not involve any external servers.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Advertising</h2>
        <p>
            Opero displays advertisements using Google AdMob, a third-party advertising
            service provided by Google.
        </p>

        <p>
            Advertisements shown in Opero are configured to be suitable for children
            and are not personalized. Opero does not use interest-based advertising.
        </p>

        <p>
            Google AdMob may collect limited, non-personal information such as device
            identifiers, IP address, or basic usage data in order to serve and measure
            ads. This data is processed in accordance with Google’s Privacy Policy.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can learn more about how Google handles data here:

            </a>
        </p>

        <h2>5. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>
            Opero does not sell or share personal data with third parties.
            Data is only shared where strictly necessary for app functionality,
            such as displaying advertisements through Google AdMob.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Children’s Privacy</h2>
        <p>
            Opero is designed to be safe for children and users of all ages.
            The app does not knowingly collect personal information from children
            under the age of 13.
        </p>

        <p>
            Opero complies with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA)
            by limiting data collection, disabling personalized advertising,
            and configuring ads to display only general-audience content.
        </p>

        <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time. Any changes will be
            published on this page and reflected within the app where appropriate.
        </p>
